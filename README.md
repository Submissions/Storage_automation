# Storage_automation

This is used internally by one team at BCM-HGSC. It has little interest for
others. The main ideas are certain filtering heuristics on storage report
files.

If using for mfts report two options #1 orphans #2 shares and #3 will be "mfts"
for submissions #1 base #2 "blank" and #3 will be "submissions"
This will be used to merge several spreadsheets for a storage report.
